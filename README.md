# Beyond the Absence — Single Moms Data Platform

**Beyond the Absence** is now live.  
It’s a platform where our stories are seen.  
Where real data meets real pain.

## 📂 Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

We merged and cleaned two main datasets:

- `postpartum_depression.csv`
- `child_health_development.csv`

Main preprocessing steps:

- ✅ Renamed columns for consistency (e.g., `Age → age`)
- ✅ Converted age ranges into numeric averages
- ✅ Dropped rows with missing values (`NaN`)
- ✅ Split timestamps into `date` and `time`
- ✅ Removed irrelevant text columns for clean correlation
- ✅ Saved the final dataset as `single_mom_dataset.csv`
